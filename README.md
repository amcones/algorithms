# algorithms

My algorithm template. Contains commonly used algorithms and data structures in competitions and academia. Written in
C++20 standard, each algorithm has a runnable test case.

See [content/include/](./content/include) for raw source code of algorithm implementation,
and [content/src/](./content/src) for runnable test cases.

## Introduction

While learning algorithms, deepen understanding and memory through implementation.

Since learning is a private matter, the code style and description will be more personal. However, code quality will be
guaranteed, allowing the code to be self-explanatory.
