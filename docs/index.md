# algorithms

My algorithm template. Contains commonly used algorithms and data structures in competitions and academia. Written in
C++20 standard, each algorithm has a runnable test case. Detailed documents are included, explaining various ideas and
key implementation points.

See [content/include/](https://github.com/amcones/algorithms/tree/main/content/include) for raw source code of algorithm
implementation,
and [content/src/](https://github.com/amcones/algorithms/tree/main/content/src) for runnable test cases.
